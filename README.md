# UFO_Sightings

### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  This project is intended to build a webpage that searches through UFO siting data and builds a table based on search criteria. Originally the only criteria available was by date. However, as part of this project city, state, country and shape were also added. 
### Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. 
#### - Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
  The filtering process is quite simple on this webpage. A user simply needs to enter a date, city, state, country, shape or any combination of the available filters and hit enter. The table will show all results for that filter (see image date and date-state below).

### Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
  One major drawback of this site is that the data is static. It does not include current data. It is recommended that further development web scrapping of other sites to collect update UFO sightings, database development to store the web scrapping data and update app and index files to display this new data on the web site.
